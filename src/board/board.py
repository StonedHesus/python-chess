        It is crucial to note, that based on the design choices of the developers, aka yours tÐ³uly; there is a
        need for a base, abstract type for the board, due to one sole reason:

                The software will allow the instantiation of different modes of chess, or games that utilise 
                the chessboard and its pieces. 

        Hence, in order to be able to minimise cohesion, and to allow further scalling to be as natural as              possible, I had decided to introduce the abstract 'proto' type, or core type if you will; for the 
        board hierarchy, ensuring us that a board abides to certain characteristics and behavioural patterns.
